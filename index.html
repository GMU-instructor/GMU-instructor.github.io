                        Welcome to my personal academic site! I created this page to show off the great work that my students are doing in my GMU classes.     
                        Here you can view posters and applications that have real world impact.
                        <br><br>
                        I built this site from scratch using HTML and CSS, learning from YouTube and other online sites. 
                        You'll learn a little more about me by clicking on the About Me link, which takes you to my GMU faculty page.
                        <br><br>
                        If you want to learn about the classes I teach, you can do so by clicking on one of the class name links.
                        <br><br>
                        I built this site to give my students a chance to show off their work on the WWW for all to see. 
                        And for future students to be inspired. 
                        Click on the Class Posters or Class Project Apps links in the menu bar on the left to see more. 
                        In particular, the apps link is pretty cool because you'll see actual working software there.
                        <br><br>
                        Any work shown on this site created by students or others will be properly attributed and exists here only with permission from all authors of the particular work shown.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of the links on here will take you to sites that are external to this one. Those links are listed under 'External Links'. 
                        <br>
                        <em>Disclaimer: At the time I created the link, the external site worked. I will try to ensure the links remain valid but click at your own risk.</em> 
                        <br><br>
                        There are many other fairly cool items on this site for you, such as a description of the CRISP-DM process, a list of project ideas, a link to my public repo on GitHub, and many other items. Stay a while, and watch this space!
