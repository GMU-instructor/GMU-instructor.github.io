<p>
    Welcome to CDS-303 Scientific Data Mining! I created this page to show off the great work that my students are doing in my CDS-303 class.     Here you can view posters and applications that have real world impact.
    <br><br>
    I built this site from scratch using HTML and CSS, learning from YouTube and other online sites. You'll learn a little more about me by clicking on the About Me link.
    <br><br>
    If you want to learn about the class, you can do so by clicking on the About the Class link.
    <br><br>
    But the real reason I built this site was to give my students a chance to show off their work on the WWW for all to see. And for future students to be inspired. Click on the Class Posters or Class Project Apps links in the menu bar on the left to see more. In particular, the apps link is pretty cool because you'll see actual working software there.
    <br><br>
    There are many other fairly cool items on this site for you, such as a description of the CRISP-DM process, a list of project ideas, a link to my public repo on GitHub, and many other items. Stay a while, and watch me!
